			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
			Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
			
			dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
			type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
			centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
			It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
			Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
			including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
